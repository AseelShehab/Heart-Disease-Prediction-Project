# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project
A machine learning project to predict whether a person has heart disease.

In this project, I used many machine learning features.......
First, I searched for a set of data related to the heart ---->Then, I explored this data and made sure that it did not contain any empty values-----> Next, I divided the data into training data and testing data -----> Then, I used a model that employs a binary classification algorithm because it is easier and faster to use----->Then we trained it on the data we had ----> finally we entered data for one person to see if they were infected or not.
